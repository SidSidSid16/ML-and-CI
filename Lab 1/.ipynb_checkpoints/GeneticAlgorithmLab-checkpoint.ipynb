    "Remember that to run any genetic algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "- We need a *population* of solutions, each of which is generated by a genome of a particular size. \n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are two main steps: *evaluating* the current population (via the `evaluate_all_candidates` function), and *generating* the population for the next generation (via the `create_next_generation` function). \n",
    "The code below is our \"starter\" GA, which contains the following functions (in order):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **onemax** is our *objective function*. It calculates the *fitness* of a *genome*\n",
    "- **selection** evaluates our population via a *tournament* - basically picking the best individual from a small number of randomly chosen members of the population\n",
    "- **crossover** carries out the task of making a new genome from the genome of two parents, by picking a random point on the genome and swapping them  - this makes two new genomes from two parent genomes\n",
    "- **mutation** then adds a further change at the individual bit level - this means that new solutions can be discovered *even if they aren't present in the previous population*\n",
    "- **genetic_algorithm** puts all this together into one operation that we can call in our studies\n",
    "\n",
